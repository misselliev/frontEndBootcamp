    <p>So far, I'm halfway a web development course and a Javascript one. I also recently finished (and successfully got a certificate) for web responsive design in <a href="http://www.FreeCodeCamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a>.</p>
    <p>My small-term goal is to become a web developer and my long-term goal, is to become a full stack developer.I would also like to have apps published both on Play store and iOs store.</p>
